# Aws-Assignment

## Overview
This assignment demonstrates the design and implementation of a fully custom AWS network built from the ground up. The objective is to gain hands-on experience with core cloud networking concepts, including VPC design, subnetting, routing, controlled internet access, and instance monitoring.In addition, the assignment showcases a common DevOps architecture pattern in which multiple EC2 instances are deployed behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The goal is to understand how load balancing, health checks, security group isolation, HTTPS termination, DNS integration, and automated scaling work together to create a highly available application architecture.
All inbound traffic is routed through the ALB, ensuring that backend EC2 instances are not directly accessible from the public internet. Two EC2 instances are deployed behind the ALB, each configured to serve different content to validate proper load balancing behavior.
